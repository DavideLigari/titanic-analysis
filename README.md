# Titanic analysis
RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg during its maiden voyage. In this project, we aim to analyze the Titanic dataset to determine the factors that influenced the survival of passengers. The dataset contains information about 887 passengers, randomly divided into a training set (710 samples) and a test set (177 cases).

## Dataset
The dataset is provided in two text files:
- `titanic-train.txt`: Contains the training set with 710 samples.
- `titanic-test.txt`: Contains the test set with 177 samples.

Each row in the files represents a different passenger and includes the following features:
- Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Sex (0 for male, 1 for female)
- Age (in years)
- Number of siblings and spouses aboard
- Number of parents and children aboard
- Passenger fare
- Survival status (1 for survived, 0 for not survived)

## Project Tasks

### 1. Train a Logistc regression model
1. What is a good value for the learning rate?
2. How many iterations are required to converge?

### 2. Analyze the Model
1. What would be your probability to survive?.
2. What is the training accuracy of the trained model?
3. Looking at the learned weights, how do individual features influence the probability of surviving?
4. What kind of passengers were most likely to survive? And what kind were likely to die?
5. Draw a scatter plot showing the distribution of the two classes in the plane defined by the two most influential features.

### 3. Evaluate the Model
1. What is the test accuracy of the model?
2. Is the model overfitting or underfitting the training set?
3. How can you increase the performance of the model?
